# TiVi Omnia relief site, what is it?

Hello! Let's start from small and move into something bigger! On this site you'll find useful tools for your TiVi assigments. If you have something to ask, feel free to contact creator >:O

## Using VSCode

### Extensions

Extensions are used to add VSCode more flexibility and functionality. They are by example, syntax highlighting for HTML or Python, auto tabbing, etc. Many of them are useful but there are way more unuseful stuff around. So which extensions to install? Well, we about to get there but later, I need to explain a bit more about VSCode.

### Workspace, what is it?

Workspace on työalusta. Tiedän, ei kovin paljon kerro tämä, siksi käsittelen tätä tarkemmin.
VSCode got workspaces, they help you to jump from folder to folder easier, without searching for it in file explorer.
For example, suppose that we got file in documents that is `python.code-workspace` and `html.code-workspace` these files contain data on which computer has a folder to open, e.g. python workspace opens a folder `C:\python` and html workspace opens folder `C:\Users\Admin\Documents\html`. These workspace files are very useful and easy to use, ain't that so? But I'll tell you later how to use them more effectively.

### Ain't end, about to come more later
